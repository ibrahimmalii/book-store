In response to your latest job posting on Upwork, I am here to apply for the post of HTML Design. I have an excellent background as a Frontend Developer along with my academic education in Computer Science and Technology. Furthermore, I have the excellence of creating upstanding designs of novelty. I firmly believe that these qualities make me different from the rest of the contestants

I would like to inform you also that I am highly skilled with HTML and CSS, which you need for this design.

For why, I believe myself to be the best candidate and a great asset to your project. My profile, portfolio, and work history are also attached herewith for your kind consideration that will help you recognize my skill.
And because it is my first job, I would like to make an offer for you and make a special discount because you will be my first client.

Thank you for taking the time to review the letter. Iâ€™ll look forward to hearing from you for further process.
Thanking you

Omar Badr
